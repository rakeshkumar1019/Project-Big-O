- Check if any loop keywords are present in the code.
 ```
 Example: for, while, do while, forEach, forIn ...etc.
 ```
- Find what is present in between the parenthesis`( )`.
- Based on the code present in the parenthesis find the partten.
```
Example of for Loop:
Partten 1: ( ; ;) |  for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
Partten 2: ( : )  |  for(int idx: arr)
```
